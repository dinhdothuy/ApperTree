# Apper Tree

Deployed Link:  https://appertree.herokuapp.com/

The Apper Tree web application provides member users a platform to quickly present an organized overview of their Apps and professional profile.  A rolling card list of member submitted Apps is displayed in an easy to use format.  The App allows members to publish their completed products to a wider audience, present projects still in the development phase, gain early access to upcoming Apps, or simply engage other users for professional feedback.  The App will also serve as a marketplace for members wishing to monetize their work.  

## App Functions

The Home page displays member submitted Apps in a scrolling card format, with each card containing the name and image of the App, along with a short synopsis about the product.  Links to deploy the App and to view the App developer's profile page are embedded in the cards.  The Home page also displays a short summary of the logged in user's profile and the Apps trending on the site.     

A Submit page allows members to submit their Apps for presentation on the website.  

Members complete a Profile page with contact information, a listing of professional skills and experience, and a listing with links to their own Apps.  

To login and access the secure Apper Tree site, users create a site account with a unique member name and password.
