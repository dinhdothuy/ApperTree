# Apper Tree

Deployed Link:  https://appertree.herokuapp.com/

The Apper Tree web application provides member users a platform to quickly present an organized overview of their apps and professional profile.  A rolling card list of member submitted apps is displayed in an easy to use format.  The app allows members to publish their completed products to a wider audience, present projects still in the development phase, gain early access to upcoming apps, or simply engage other members for professional feedback.  The app will also serve as a marketplace for members wishing to monetize their work.  

## App Functions

The Home page displays member submitted apps in a scrolling card format, with each card containing the name and image of the app, along with a short synopsis about the product.  Links to deploy the app and to view the app developer's profile page are embedded in the cards.  The Home page also displays a short summary of the logged in user's profile and popular apps trending on the site.     

A Submit page allows members to submit their apps for presentation on the website.  

Members complete a Profile page with contact information, a listing of professional skills and experience, and a listing with links to their own apps.  

To login and access the secure Apper Tree site, users create a site account with a unique member name and password.
